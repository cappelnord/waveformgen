This comes with a basic makefile. Just type 

>> make

if you're under Linux.

You need the following libraries:

GD2 (http://www.libgd.org/)
libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

If you're using Mac OS X you can install the libraries with MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

>> sudo port install libsndfile
>> sudo port install gd2

Because the Header/Library files are on different locations you need to compile another target:

>> make macports

Or if you are using Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac OS X:

>> sudo brew install libsndfile
>> sudo brew install gd

Headers and libraries are in default locations, but as we don't need to include libpng, this target:

>> make homebrew

 There is also a clean target but no install target.
