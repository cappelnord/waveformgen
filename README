This is just a simple tool to generate a waveform image in png format
from an audio file. It displays peak amplitude as well as RMS amplitude,
just as Audacity does. It is only meant to draw an overview. Using it on
a too small audio file will produce a quite bad result. I use it in a
web application but maybe you need it in other scenarios. You can either
use it as a command line tool or use wfg_generateImage() in your
program. Use this tool at own risk. It is not special, it is not fast,
it is not fancy but it does the job (at least for me).

Please run
>> waveformgen -h
for help.
